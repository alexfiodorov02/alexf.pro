This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# My Personal Site

A personal site built with Next.js because... why not? 🚀

A simple HTML page would've done the job, but I like building things with React and the component structure makes it super easy to add new sections or features later. I can easily throw in a blog section for technical posts, some fun animations or features, or whatever else comes to mind.

Built with Create Next App because sometimes you just want to skip the boilerplate and get to the good stuff.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
